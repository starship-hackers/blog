## Dependencies [&#x219F;](#contents)

* Erlang
* `rebar3`
* `npm`

To set up the blog SASS infrastructure, run the following:

```bash
$ make gulp-setup
```

## Building

There are two supported ways of building the Starship Hackers Blog HTML
content and CSS:

* using `make` targets (which call erlang under the hood)
* running `blog` functions from the LFE REPL


### With `make` [&#x219F;](#contents)

To (re)generate the static files:

```bash
$ make blog
```

That will build both the HTML files as well as the CSS.

To only build the HTML:

```bash
$ make blog-html-only
```

To only build the CSS, JS, etc.:

```bash
$ make assets
```

Additionally, a `make` target is provided which compiles everything fresh,
starts up a local dev HTTP server, and watches for changes in CSS, HTML
templates, and LFE code:

```bash
$ make serve-watch
```

The CSS watcher is a backgrounded `sass` process, and not native LFE, so you
will need to kill it when you are done:

```bash
$ make css-unwatch
```


### In the REPL [&#x219F;](#contents)

To (re)generate the static files, start up an LFE REPL:

```bash
$ make repl
```
```

```

To generate the blog:

```cl
lfe> (blog:gen)
Created docs/index.html.
...
ok
```


To run a local copy of the development server and view your work at
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), run the following:

```bash
lfe> (blog:httpd)
ok
```

The CSS files are managed with [sass](http://sass-lang.com). After changing
values in the `priv/sass/lfe*.scss` files or in the
`priv/sass/lfe-sass/` subdirectories, you'll need to rebuild:

```bash
$ make assets
```
