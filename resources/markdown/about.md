This is a blog and general resource for reading about, exploring, and
learning to code for the starships of the future. The focus is placed on
the reliability and fault-tolerance in software systems required when lives
and essential communications are at stake.

* Have decades of proven production deployments supporting billions of
  users
* Have a concept of and patterns for working with systems of systems
* Support dependencies between components (child/parent relationships)
  and offer various pre-defined strategies for autoamtically restarting
  critical systems
* Native support for hot-code reloading, allowing systems to be updated
  without downtime

In addition to posts that focus on prototyping starship software systems,
this blog offers posts on topic interest and goings-on in related fields.

We hope your have as much fun here as we do, preparing for space travel now!
